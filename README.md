# Asteroid-Prediction
This repository features an Asteroid Hazard Prediction system that utilizes machine learning to assess the risk of asteroids colliding with Earth. By analyzing key features such as size, velocity, and trajectory, the model predicts whether an asteroid poses a threat. It aims to enhance awareness and safety against cosmic hazards.
